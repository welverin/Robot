## Raspberry ?

First version of this project was based on Raspberry Pi Zero W, the software was written in Python and everything worked very well. 

Why did I change the Head to ESP32 ?

The are 3 reasons. 

The first was the power supply, I didn't have the physical space for a battery to power the raspberry independently from the servos.

The second is the boot times and any bluetooth pairing problems. 

The third is the possibility of damaging the SD card with an uncontrolled shutdown.
